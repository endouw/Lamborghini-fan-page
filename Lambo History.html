                <p>Manufacturing magnate Italian Ferruccio Lamborghini founded the company in 1963 with the objective of producing a refined grand touring car to compete with offerings from established marques such as Ferrari.
                     The company's first models, such as the 350 GT, were released in the mid 1960s. Lamborghini was noted for the 1966 Miura sports coupé, which used a rear mid-engine, rear wheel drive layout.</p>

                <p>Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first ten years, but sales fell in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. Ferruccio Lamborghini sold the company to Georges-Henri Rossetti and René Leimer and retired in 1974. The company went bankrupt in 1978, and was placed in the receivership of brothers Jean-Claude and Patrick Mimran in 1980. </p>

                    <p>The Mimrans purchased the company out of receivership by 1984 and invested heavily in the its expansion. Under the Mimrans' management, Lamborghini's model line was expanded from the Countach to include the Jalpa sports car and the LM002 high performance off-road vehicle.

                        The Mimrans sold Lamborghini to the Chrysler Corporation in 1987.</p>

In addition, the company produces V12 engines for offshore powerboat racing.

                                <p>The Lamborghini logo shows a bull or Taurus that is the brand founder’s zodiac sign. Ferruccio Lamborghini was extremely interested in Spanish bullfighting sport that is also shown in the logo. Bullfighting is the main part of Lamborghini’s style. Furthermore many Lamborghini cars are called as famous bulls. 
                                    Ferruccio Lamborghini is usually accused of logo’s similarity to Ferrari’s logo. It was not considered to be an accident from Ferruccio, who had a lingering rivalry with Ferrari. Lamborghini become so impressed looking for the majestic Miura bulls that he derived to adopt a fighting bull as the sign for the automaker Lamborghini would open shortly. Don Eduardo Miura was really glad and surprised when Lamborghini called one of the vehicles “Miura”.</p>

                                    <p>The Lamborghini logo symbolizes the founder’s zodiac character – the Taurus or a bull. Ferruccio’s love of bullfights was depicted in the logo and Lamborghini cars get their styles from famous bulls. 
                                        The golden bull ready for bullfights is depicted on the black shield with the golden title “Lamborghini” above. 
                                        The bull represents Lamborghini sports cars’ power.</p>

                                        <p>The shape of the Lamborghini symbol depicts a shield and demonstrates golden snorting bull. 
                                            The emblem was symbolical like any other car logos. This bull represents consistency, fortitude and power. 
                                            Being a manufacturer of high-quality sporting cars, the logo has immense recognition deeply along with other brand logos. The bull symbol actually signs founder’s, Ferruccio, zodiacal sign (Taurus), besides; it is obviously attended by the manufacturer’s title, Lamborghini. 
                                            Contrary to some other “patriot” Italian manufacturers, Lamborghini does not apply the Italian colors on its symbol.</p>

                                            <p>The famous golden Taurus with a black field of the Lamborgini symbol holds great similarity to the horse and yellow field of the Ferrari symbol. 
                                                The similarity was not just a coincidence, since Ferruccio has a longstanding rivalry with Ferrari. 
                                                Since the golden bull in the Lamborghini symbol depicts excellence and wealthy tradition of the manufacturer, the black color reflects its power, prestige, elegance and integrity.</p>
